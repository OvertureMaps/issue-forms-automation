        Systemd version the issue has been seen with
        Do not submit bug reports about anything but the two most recently released *major* systemd versions upstream!
        If there have been multiple stable releases for that major version, please consider updating to a recent one before reporting an issue.
        When using a distro package, please make sure that the version reported is meaningful for upstream.
        See https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/tags for the list of most recent releases.
        For older version please use distribution trackers (see https://systemd.io/CONTRIBUTING#filing-issues).

        Make sure to enclose the pasted kernel version in `backticks`, so that GitHub doesn't convert the `#` character typically included in it into a reference to old GitHub issues.

        Additional program output to the terminal or log subsystem illustrating the issue.
        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.

        Please paste relevant program terminal or journal output here, ideally
        when generated in debug mode (try setting the SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
        environment variable). For very long copy/pasted data consider using a
        service like https://gist.github.com/. Where copy/paste is not possible
        (for example early boot or late shutdown), a photo of the screen might do
        too, but text is always much preferred.
